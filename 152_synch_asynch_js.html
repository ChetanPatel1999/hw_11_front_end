Sync in JS

 Synchronous
 Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
 Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

 Asynchronous
 Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get
 blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
 Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions
 immediately and doesn't block the flow.

<!-- <script>
    //synchronus prgramm
    console.log("one")
    console.log("two")
    console.log("three")
    console.log("four")
 </script> -->

<script>
    //asynchronus prgramming
    function getdata(id) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("data " + id)
        }, 2000);
    }

    console.log("one")
    getdata(101)
    console.log("three");
    console.log("four"); 
    console.log("five"); 
</script>
