<!-- 
JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
primitive data types are 7
String
Number
Bigint
Boolean
Undefined
let car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined check by typeof
Null
Symbol
Non - primitive 
Object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Most programming languages have many number types:

(integers):
byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

(floating-point):
float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

Javascript numbers are always one type:
double (64-bit floating point).
no built-in function in java script to check how many byte is used by variable
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.

JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer 
values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects:

Built-in object types can be:

objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.
