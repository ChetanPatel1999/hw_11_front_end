<!-- 
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Only use let if you can't use const

4. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

let, const & var
 var : Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable. 
 let : Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable. 
 const : Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.

Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

Variable Rules
 Variable names are case sensitive; “a” & “A” is different.
 Only letters, digits, underscore( _ ) and $ is allowed. (not even space)
 Only a letter, underscore( _ ) or $ should be 1st character.
 Reserved words cannot be variable names.

 Common Naming Conventions in JavaScript:-
 camelCase :- userName, totalPrice (variable name ,function name , object)
 snake_case :- max_marks, MAX_MARKS (constants)
 PascalCase :- UserName , TotalPrice (classes name)
